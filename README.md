The Rotational Force Engine is a vector-based 2D game engine I was working on, along with an editor for it. It's actually pretty fancy, as far as it got anyway. It supports splines, stroking, dynamic level of detail, mounting and linking objects, nifty object tracking and camera animation, and, well, lots of features. As usual, though, I never finished it.
